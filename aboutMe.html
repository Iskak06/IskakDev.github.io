        Hi, I'm ----. My story within programming began in my first year of
        middle school. I started experiencing with C#/CSharp by looking at
        <span
          ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA"
            >Brackeys</a
          ></span
        >
        tutorial series on
        <span
          ><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGD0vn-QIkg"
            >C# basics</a
          ></span
        >. This was my first EVER time programming. Second year of middle school
        we could choose a side-class, there were many options, and one of them
        were programming. I chose programming where we did many different
        things, such as:
        <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a></span
        >, Microbit programming,
        <span><a href="https://trinket.io">Trinket</a></span> programming and a
        tiny bit web dev. I also started to look into
        <span><a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-engine">Unity</a></span
        >, a game engine. I didn't really persue it though. After two years of
        programming in school, I started high school. I chose general studies,
        which means that the only programming I do is in my free-time.
        <br />
        <br />
        After my C#/CSharp period, I took a break from programming (except for
        the school related programming). My web dev "career" started in high
        school. I saw that my fathers local company was missing a good, finished
        website, so I took the task of making a new one from scratch. I got some
        help making it from random people and another person I've been aquanted
        with in my journey (they helped me when I was stuck). After a while, and
        many hours, the website was finished. I took a brake after this, as I
        felt I had nothing to do/make. After some time I presented the website
        and made some small changes and it's officially done.
        <br />
        <br />
        After high school, my plan is to go to univerity and go further into IT
        and Programming. I would like to choose between a backend or frontend
        education, and maybe both.
